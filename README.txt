Syndicate all your content - pages, posts, and custom types - in one unified RSS feed.

== Description ==

WP Omni RSS enhances WordPress's RSS functionality by including all content types in your site's feeds. Whether you're using standard posts, pages, or custom post types, everything can be included in a single, unified feed.

This plugin was inspired by Adam Newbold's essay ["Everything is a Web Page"](https://notes.neatnik.net/2025/01/everything-is-a-web-page), which argues that the distinction between static pages and blog posts is merely a mental model, and that all web content can be treated as syndication-worthy pages.

Features:

* Include any content type in your RSS feed
* Per-post control over feed inclusion
* Custom change descriptions for feed items
* Revision tracking in feeds
* Configurable feed formatting
* Support for all public post types
